[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[b]Do i need to start a new campaign for this?[/b]

Yes!

[b]I only see the first 4 ability rows and can't scroll in the promotion screen![/b]

DEACTIVATE THE FOLLOWING MODS SINCE THEY ARE ALREADY INTEGRATED IN THIS MOD

[list]
[*] [WOTC] Detailed Soldier Lists
[*] [WOTC] New Promotion Screen by Default
[*] View Locked Skills - Wotc
[/list]

After that delete %User\Documents\My Games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Config

[b]Will custom class mods work with this?[/b]
Yes

[b]What about Faction Heros, SPARKS, Psi Soldiers?[/b]
They are not touched by this mod and should work normally

[b]My soldier keep getting promoted to basegame/other classes?[/b]
Its a strange bug cause by the config system for some people.
Use the mod [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1148535137] Disable Any Class Wotc[/url][/u] and disable all classes but UniversalSoldier in the ingame mod options.

[b]I have a lot of plugins and the promotion screen skips specializations when scrolling[/b]
Use [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131906393] [WoTC] Row-Based Scrolling Speed Wotc[/url][/u]
or consider using the second wave options to limit the available specs.

[h1]Mod compatibility[/h1]
Most mods should be compatible. If you have an issue let me know.
Other Overhaul mods like MINT and A Better Barracks obviously clash in some areas.

Known incompatibilities:
- [WOTC] Detailed Soldier Lists
- [WOTC] New Promotion Screen by Default
- View Locked Skills - Wotc
- "Configure Upgrade Slots" doesnt work cause this mod set all slots to 3
- "Hack Plus" leads to insane high hacking stats

[h1]A note on the beta status[/h1]
This mod will change frequently.
Therefor it might be needed that you rebuild you soldiers.
Use the command RPGO_RebuildSelectedSoldier for that purpose.
