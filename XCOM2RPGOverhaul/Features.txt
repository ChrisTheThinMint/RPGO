[h1]Soldier AP[/h1]
Since you can raise stats with Soldier AP the rank up AP bonus is raised to 30, plus a bonus depending on the Combat Intelligence Level:

Standard = 0
AboveAverage = 5
Gifted = 7
Genius = 10
Savant = 15

The baseline ability cost for buying abilities is raised too however:

0 for Squaddie abilities
25 for Corporal abilities
25 for Sergeant abilities
25 for Lieutenant abilities
25 for Captain abilities
25 for Major abilities
35 for Colonel abilities
45 for Brigadier abilities

Individual abilities may cost more or less depending on their powerlevel.

The ability point rewards are doubled and the mission cap is raised from 2 to 10 AP/mission

[h1]Soldier SP[/h1]

Soldier Stat Points are a new system introduced by RPGO. Its a dedicated pool that can only used for raising stats.

By default your soldiers get 15SP per promotion. Currently there are no other sources to get SP.

In addition your soldiers have a "natural aptitude" level. It serves the same purpose as combat intelligence but for stat points.

As with combat intelligence there are 5 levels of natural aptitude:

Mortal +0 SP / Promotion
Good Genes +5 SP / Promotion
Peak Human +10  SP / Promotion
Super Human +15 SP / Promotion
Godlike +20 SP / Promotion

You can see the aptitude level of a soldier int the soldier list (a new icon next to combat intelligence with the same color code) and on the stats screen.
