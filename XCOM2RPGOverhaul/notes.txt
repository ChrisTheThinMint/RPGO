Version 0.11.1
- Added support for specialization "packages" (ForceComplementarySpecializations). 
- Choosing starting perks is a separate option (RPGO Origins) now.
- Removed ripjack giving reckoning
- Gauntlets no longer require a perk to be used, instead they are available to all soldiers. They have no rocket and only one flamethrower charge by default.
- The two Gauntlet specs have been overhauled, they no longer depend on Heavy Armaments, which makes them able to be picked seperately with the new SWO options:
- The Purifier spec now starts with High Pressure Tanks, which restores the gauntlet's flamethrower charges back to two. Phosphorus was removed to make space for this perk, as it was one of the weakest perks. Napalm-X was moved to rank 4 (Captain) because it was a bit strong in its previous position.
- The Rocketeer spec now starts with Shock and Awe, which adds the rocket to the Gauntlet and is required for all other perks. There is also a new perk: HEAT Warheads, which adds pierce and shred to both the rocket and any other explosives the soldier uses.
