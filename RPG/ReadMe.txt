[h1]About this overhaul[/h1]
The idea of this mod was born out of my passion for oldschool rpg games.
I thought it would be cool to develope every single soldier in every way you want and give it every weapon or item you want. 

So here it is. The mod replaces the vanilla class by one class starting as "Soldier".

The Soldier class can use every weapon (supporting Primary Secondaries, LW2 Secondary Weapons and Utility Slot Sidearms).

This class has 14 rows of abilities (named specializations) with 7 ranks each (98 abilities total) to choose from. I am planning to even expand on this.

When your soldier evolves your class name and icon changes dynamicly to the specialization you have the most perks from.

On squaddie your soldier will get two random starting abilities from a pool to give each soldier an idea to where he/she could be deveveloped.

Any combination of abilities and weapons are possible. For example you can create a cannon wielding medic, a gunslinging grenadier, sniper with ripjack or whatever you can imagine.

Most abilities work with each weapon, the secondary weapon abilities work with their associated secondary regardless if it is in the primary, secondary or utility slot (if you are using Utility Slot Sidearms WOTC)

Another big change is the possibility to upgrade the soldiers stats with ability points. Therefor i designed a completely new ui screen.

For overall balance and because i wanted to i overhauled the weapon mechanics and how most weapon attachements work.

[h1]Soldier AP[/h1]
Since you can raise stats with Soldier AP the rank up AP bonus is raised to 30
plus a bonus depending on the Combat Intelligence Level

Standard=0
AboveAverage=5
Gifted=7
Genius=10
Savant=15

the ability cost for buying abilities is raised too however

0 for Squaddie abilities
10 for Corporal abilities
15 for Sergeant abilities
15 for Lieutenant abilities
20 for Captain abilities
20 for Major abilities
25 for Colonel abilities
50 for Brigadier abilities

The ability point rewards are doubled and the mission cap is raised from 2 to 10 AP/mission
