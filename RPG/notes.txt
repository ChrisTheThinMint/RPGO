- Unlocks cool under pressure as GTS Perk
- Allow special shots like rapid fire and chain shot as valid second actions for LightEmUp.

- Fix SurgicalPrecision

- Moved LEU later in the tree and added ability prerequesites for it
- Moved CloseandPersonal in the Assault tree
- Moved Deadeye in the infantry tree
- Autofire is no longer guaranteed to destroy cover (33% chance).

- Added [b]32[/b] new squaddie perks from Ziodyne's MINT Classless Overhaul mod. Every soldier will now get one of these aptitudes as well as one of the 19 standard squaddie perks, giving you a total of 608 possible combinations for your squaddies - now every soldier will be a little unique!
- The Sentinel specialization now gets the eponymous [b]Sentinel[/b] perk from Long War 2 at Corporal rank. [b]Cool Under Pressure[/b] will become a GTS perk.
- The Assault specialization has undergone a few changes. Both [b]Close Encounters[/b] and [b]Bring 'Em On[/b] are now available at higher ranks, [b]Close Combat Specialist[/b] and [b]Deadeye[/b] become available a little earlier. This should improve the overall balance of the specialization.
- Fixed [b]Bring 'Em On[/b]. It now grants +1 critical hit damage per two enemies instead of +1 per enemy.
